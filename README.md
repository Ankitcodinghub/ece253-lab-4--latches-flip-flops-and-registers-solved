The purpose of this exercise is to investigate the fundamental synchronous logic elements: latches, flip-flops, and registers.

1 Work Flow

For Part I you will use logisim or the breadboard in lab to build and simulate the circuit.

For Parts II and III of the lab you should begin by writing and testing Verilog code and com- piling it with Quartus. You should be prepared to show schematics, Verilog, and simulations to your TA, if requested. You must simulate your circuit with ModelSim using reasonable test vectors written in the format used in Lab 2 for the simulation files.

2 PartI

Figure 1 shows the circuit for a gated D latch (textbook Section 5.3). In this part, you will build the gated D latch using the logisim simulator. Or if you wish, you can also do this using the breadboard you used in Lab 1.

<li>In your lab book, draw a schematic of the gated D latch using interconnected 7400-series chips. Recall from Lab 1 what a gate-level schematic looks like.</li>
<li>Build the gated D latch using the chips and breadboard. Use switches to control the clock and D input. Use lights to make Qa and Qb visible. Don’t forget to hook up the power and ground on all of your chips!</li>

(b) If you are doing simulation with logisim

i. Using the logisim Gates library build the circuit shown in Figure 1. Note that when you select the NAND gate tool, you can first change the number of inputs to 2.

Study the behaviour of the latch for different D and Clk settings. Observe Q when Clk is set high and you change D several times. Then observe Q when Clk is set low and you change D several times. How do you set Q high? How do you set Q low?

What are all the cases you need to show that your D latch is working correctly?

In modern digital circuit design, latches are rarely used, and only in very special circum- stances. The most common storage element today is the edge-triggered D flip flop. One way to build an edge-triggered D flip flop is to connect two D latches in series with the two D latches using opposite edges of the clock. This is called a primary-secondary1 flip flop (textbook Section 5.4.1). The output of the primary-secondary flip flop changes on a clock edge, unlike the latch, which changes according to the level of the clock. For a positive edge-triggered flip flop, the output changes when the clock edge rises. The Verilog code for a positive edge-triggered flip flop is shown in Figure 2 (textbook Section A.14.2, A.14.3). This flip flop also has an active-low, synchronous reset, meaning that the reset only happens when Reset b = 0 on the rising clock edge. If q is declared as reg q, then you get a single flip flop. If q is declared as reg[7:0] q, then you get eight parallel flip flops, which is called an 8-bit register. Of course, d should have the same width as q.

Starting with the circuit you built for Lab 3 Part III, build an ALU with the eight operations as shown in the pseudo-code in Figure 3. Pay attention and note that the operations of the

ALU here are not all the same as in Lab 3 Part III. The output of the ALU is to be stored in an 8-bit register (textbook Section A.14.4) and the four least-significant bits of the register output are connected to the B input of the ALU. You may want to review Verilog operators (textbook Section 4.6.5). Figure 4 shows the required connections.

3.1 What to Do

The top-level module of your design should have the following signature declaration:

7. If you do not have a board, you can use fake fpga to test that your circuit behaves as expected.

4 Part III

Figure 5 shows a positive edge-triggered flip-flop with several multiplexers. In this part of the lab, you will use eight instances of the circuit in Figure 5 to design a left/right 8-bit rotating register with parallel load shown in Figure 6.

A rotating register uses the concept of shifting bits (text Section 5.8, A.14.5) in the register. When bits are shifted in a register, it means that the bits are copied to the next flip flop on the left or the right. For example, to shift the bits left, each flip flop loads the value of the flip flop to its right when the clock edge occurs. The term rotating comes from how the bits at the ends of the register are handled. In the left-shift example, the flip flop at the right end of the register has no right neighbour. One option is to load a zero, but for rotation we load the value of the flip flop at the left end of the register. The behaviour is as if the register were really a ring because the left and right ends are connected.

The LoadLeft input of all eight instances of the circuit in Figure 5 should be tied to the single rotating register input RotateRight because when you want to rotate the bits right, you have to load the bit to the left. The loadn input of all eight instances should be tied to the single rotating register input ParallelLoadn. The clock input of all eight instances should be tied to the single rotating register input clock. Create an 8-bit-wide rotating register input DATA IN, whose individual wires DATA IN7 to DATA IN0 are tied to the D input of each instance of the circuit in Figure 5. Likewise, create an 8-bit-wide rotating register

The remaining connections between the eight instances of the circuit in Figure 5 should realize the following behaviour:

<li>Simulate your rotating register with ModelSim to satisfy yourself that your circuit is working. In your simulation, you should perform the reset operation first. Then, clock the register for several cycles to demonstrate rotation in the left and right directions. (NOTE: If you do not perform a reset first, your simulation will not work! Try simulating without doing reset first and see what happens. Can you explain the results?)
Be prepared to justify that your test cases are enough to give confidence that your circuit is working. When you are satisfied with your simulations, you can submit to the Automarker.

Use SW7−0 as the inputs DATA IN7−0 and SW9 as a synchronous active high reset. Use KEY1 as the ParallelLoadn input, KEY2 as the RotateRight input and KEY3 as the ASRight input. Use KEY0 as the clock, but read the important note below about switch bouncing. Be reminded that the KEY s output 0 when pressed and 1, when not pressed.

Note: All mechanical switches, such as a push/toggle button, will often make contact several times due the electrical contacts bouncing. This happens quickly in human time, but not in electrical time. With a bouncing switch you can observe multiple high-frequency toggles making it difficult to create single clock edges. If you run into bounce problems with KEY0 for your clock you are welcome to try using any of the other keys.
